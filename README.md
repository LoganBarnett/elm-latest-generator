## Wishlist ##
* [ ] Use a better build pipeline such as webpack. [jolly.js](https://github.com/LoganBarnett/jolly.js) might be useful here. See also [elm-webpack-loader](https://github.com/rtfeldman/elm-webpack-loader).
* [ ] Introduce [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) over something such as Sass.
* [ ] Hot reloading?
* [ ] Better npm configuration.
* [ ] Better elm-package configuration.
* [ ] Documentation for how to use without interaction
* [ ] CONTRIB guide
